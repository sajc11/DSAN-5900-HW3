    "text": "“The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable.”\n— Mahatma Gandhi\n\n311 is a city’s promise to listen. A pothole, a broken light, an abandoned sofa — each call is a signal. A test. A measure of trust.\nSan Francisco’s 311 hotline, like those in most major cities, was built to respond to everyday problems. But when half a million service requests are logged, patterns emerge — and so do disparities.\nThis project explores the stories hiding in that data: who gets help, how fast, and why.\n\n\n\nEvery dot in our data represents a resident’s voice — and a test of government responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe began with four core questions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n1. What drives the number of requests submitted in different neighborhoods?\n2. What influences how quickly or reliably a case is resolved?\n3. Does photo evidence increase the likelihood or speed of resolution?\n4. Are there disparities based on race, income, or geography?\n\n\nWe also explored time trends, disparities by case type, and resolution variation across neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe analyzed over 519,000 records of 311 service requests filed in San Francisco during 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. Each record includes:\n\nCase type and submission method\n\nWhether a photo was attached\n\nTime to resolution and resolution status\n\nNeighborhood location and timestamp\n\nNeighborhood-level demographics: race, income, turnout\n\nThese were cleaned and transformed using Python and R, joined with census data and spatial overlays, and structured for statistical analysis and storytelling.\n\n\n\nIncome and race strongly correlate with resolution rates — but correlation isn’t causation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Example: Pothole Request\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        Impact of Photo Evidence on Resolution\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        Most Frequent Case Types\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    Previous\n  \n  \n    \n    Next\n  \n\n\n\n&lt;img src=\"assets/images/pothole_example.jpg\" alt=\"Pothole case\"&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"image-caption\"&gt;Example: Pothole Request (JavaScript disabled - carousel not available)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 311 system is designed for accessibility and equity. But our analysis reveals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings\n\n\n\n\nSome neighborhoods receive quicker and more consistent service\n\nPhoto evidence significantly increases resolution likelihood\n\nRace, income, and civic turnout correlate with resolution patterns\n\n\n\n\nThese gaps — while subtle — matter. Because a small delay for one neighborhood might mean chronic neglect for another.\n\n\n\nEven frequent complaints aren’t treated equally across the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dashboard is built for:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResidents who want to know how their neighborhood compares\n\nCity officials seeking fairer resource allocation\n\nCivic tech advocates promoting transparency\n\nResearchers and data scientists interested in applied policy analysis\n\n\n\nWhether you’re a policy student, data enthusiast, or simply a curious citizen — we invite you to explore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to dive deeper into the modeling details, statistical tests, and regression coefficients?\n\n  Download the full paper (PDF) \n\n\n\n\n\n“Data doesn’t change the world. Stories do — especially when the data is honest, and the stories are true.”\n\nLet us know if you’d like to reuse this work or bring it to your city.\nThe code is modular, the questions are transferable — and the insights can empower communities far beyond San Francisco."

# What Happens After You Call 311?

> "The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable."  
> — Mahatma Gandhi

311 is a city's promise to listen. A pothole, a broken light, an abandoned sofa — each call is a signal. A test. A measure of trust.

San Francisco's 311 hotline, like those in most major cities, was built to respond to everyday problems. But when half a million service requests are logged, patterns emerge — and so do disparities.

This project explores the stories hiding in that data: who gets help, how fast, and why.

## Research Questions

We began with four core questions:

::: {.callout-tip}
**1. What drives the number of requests submitted in different neighborhoods?**  
**2. What influences how quickly or reliably a case is resolved?**  
**3. Does photo evidence increase the likelihood or speed of resolution?**  
**4. Are there disparities based on race, income, or geography?**
:::

We also explored time trends, disparities by case type, and resolution variation across neighborhoods.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## The Dataset

We analyzed over **519,000 records** of 311 service requests filed in San Francisco during 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. Each record includes:

- Case type and submission method  
- Whether a photo was attached  
- Time to resolution and resolution status  
- Neighborhood location and timestamp  
- Neighborhood-level demographics: race, income, turnout

These were cleaned and transformed using **Python** and **R**, joined with census data and spatial overlays, and structured for statistical analysis and storytelling.

## Why It Matters

The 311 system is designed for accessibility and equity. But our analysis reveals:

::: {.callout-warning title="Key Findings"}
- Some neighborhoods receive quicker and more consistent service  
- Photo evidence significantly increases resolution likelihood  
- Race, income, and civic turnout correlate with resolution patterns  
:::

These gaps — while subtle — matter. Because a small delay for one neighborhood might mean chronic neglect for another.

  <img src="assets/images/static_viz/top_10_most_frequent_cases_with_avg_resolution_rate.png" alt="Frequent case types and resolution rates">
  <p class="image-caption">Even frequent complaints aren't treated equally across the city.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Who This Is For

This dashboard is built for:

::: {.callout-note}
- **Residents** who want to know how their neighborhood compares  
- **City officials** seeking fairer resource allocation  
- **Civic tech advocates** promoting transparency  
- **Researchers and data scientists** interested in applied policy analysis
:::

Whether you're a policy student, data enthusiast, or simply a curious citizen — we invite you to explore.

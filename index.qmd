> **"Cities speak through their systems."**  
> This dashboard listens closely to what San Francisco's 311 requests reveal — about equity, efficiency, and responsiveness.

# Behind Every Service Request, a Story

When a streetlight goes dark or a sidewalk cracks, a resident might reach for their phone and dial 311. In doing so, they become a data point — one of over half a million calls made in San Francisco between 2012 and 2018.

But who gets help fastest? Where does the system lag — and why?

This dashboard explores the people, patterns, and disparities embedded in city service data. Scroll to uncover the story.

## Resolution Rates by Neighborhood

This interactive map visualizes how well each neighborhood's requests are resolved. Try toggling between requests **with** and **without** photo evidence to see the impact.

## The Power of Photo Evidence

Cases with photos are resolved nearly **30% faster** on average. This bar chart makes the difference clear:

```{python}
plot_photo_effect()
```

## Which Case Types Get Resolved?

Some services are handled efficiently; others fall through the cracks. This chart ranks the top 10 case types by resolution rate.

```{python}
plot_case_type()
```

## Income Disparities Across Neighborhoods

Hover over this dot map to see average income by neighborhood. How does income relate to resolution speed?

## Subset Selection: The Most Predictive Features

Using R² and BIC, we identify the most impactful predictors of resolution success.

```

## Key Takeaways

<div class="key-takeaways">
  <div class="key-point">Photo evidence speeds up service.</div>
  <div class="key-point">Resolution rates are uneven across income and racial lines.</div>
  <div class="key-point">Case type matters — some requests are much more likely to be resolved.</div>
</div>

## Why This Matters

Municipal data isn't just numbers. It's a record of who gets served, and who doesn't. In a city striving for equity, these patterns must be visible — so they can be challenged and changed.
